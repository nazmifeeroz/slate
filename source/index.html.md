# Introduction

Welcome to the Loyalty Pass API! You can use our API to access SkiesPass API endpoints, which can store and create individual Loyalty Pass in our database. The pass can then be updated with its own endpoints.

This API code will be used in JSON format.

# Authentication

> To authorize:

```php
<?php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client;

$client->request('POST', 'https://skiespass.com/api/loyalty', [
    'headers'       => [
        'Authorization' => <api_key>,
    ]
]);
?>
```

> Make sure to replace `<api_key>` with your API key.

SkiesPass uses API keys to allow access to the API. Please contact our Web Team to retrieve an API key.

SkiesPass expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`POST https://skiespass.com/api/loyalty`

`Authorization: <api_key>`

<aside class="notice">
 Make sure to replace <code><api_key></code> with your API key.

# Loyalty Pass

## Creating a pass

> The request should have a body like this:

```php
<?php
$client->request('POST', 'https://skiespass.com/api/loyalty/', [
  'json'    => [
    "template_id"         => "1",
    "name"                => "Guest Name",
    "company_name"        => "Company Co.",
    "membership_level"    => "VIP",
    "membership_number"   => "DODER23W1",
    "points_accumulated"  => "30",
    "points_balance"      => "1250"
  ]
]);
?>
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "template_id": "1",
  "name": "Guest Name",
  "company_name": "Company Co.",
  "membership_level": "VIP",
  "membership_number": "DODER23W1",
  "points_accumulated": "30",
  "points_balance": "1250"
}
```

> Errors if pass creation is not succesful.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "API key is not authorized."
}

{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Template ID is invalid."
}

{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Duplicate pass detected."
}
```

In the HTTP request body, a json is expected when creating a pass.
